function [F,G] = buildLiftedSytemMatrix(A,B)
% function gives F and G in the (equivalent) expressions
% deltax = F*deltax0 + G*deltau
% x = x0 + F*deltax0 + G*deltau
% where x0 is the full, lifted state trajectory, (column state vector at
% every step stacked vertically) and deltax0 is the deviation in initial
% conditions between iterations so if the system has N states, deltax0 is N
% by 1.
% inputs A and B are 3D arrays of A and B matrices where the third index
% runs along the parameterization variable.



% Preallocate F as cell array, each cell is 1 block of block matrix
F = cell(size(A,3),1);

% Preallocate G as cell array, each cell is 1 block of block matrix
G = cell(size(B,3),size(B,3));
G(:,:) = {zeros(size(B(:,:,1)))};
G{1,1} = B(:,:,1); % Set the first block

for ii = 2:size(B,3) % Run each row
    F{ii} = A(:,:,ii)*F{ii-1};

    for jj = 1:ii-1 % set lower half elements by multiplying with the line above
       G{ii,jj} = A(:,:,ii)*G{ii-1,jj};
